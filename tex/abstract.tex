The goal of this paper is to introduce the functional programming paradigm touching on its origins and some of its core concepts.
Concepts such as: immutability, functions as first class citzens, higher order functions and recursion are explored throughout the text.
In order to showcase part of the functional development process and thinking, a regular expression search engine is implemented.
As such, the basics of regular expressions and automatas are introduced to contextualize the problem.
The article introduces the software architecture developed to implement the regular expresession engine and dives into parts of the code in order to showcase how key-concepts in functional programming were explored to solve the problem.
